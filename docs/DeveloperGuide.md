### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jarvis/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jarvis/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletestudent 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jarvis/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jarvis/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student`, `Task` and `Lesson` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jarvis/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `JarvisParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddTaskCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a task).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletestudent 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletestudent 1` Command](images/DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `JarvisParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddTaskCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddTaskCommand`) which the `JarvisParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddTaskCommandParser`, `DeleteStudentCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jarvis/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the student data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

Similar analogues exist for task and lesson data. The class diagram is similar apart from:
1. the different naming (`TaskBook` and `LessonBook` instead of `StudentBook`, `UniqueTaskList` and `UniqueLessonList` instead of `UniqueStudentList`)
2. the components of the `Task` and `Lesson` classes. For example, instead of `StudentName` and `MatricNumber`, `Task` is composed out of `TaskDesc`, `TaskDeadline` etc. 

In particular, the following class diagram shows how a lesson is represented in the `Model` component.

<img src="images/LessonClassDiagram.png" width="650" />

Note that the 3 Lesson subtypes (`Studio`, `MasteryCheck` and `Consult`) inherit from the abstract `Lesson` class. Each lesson consists of smaller components such as `LessonAttendance`, `TimePeriod` etc.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jarvis/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The above diagram only shows the UserPrefs and StudentBook Storage in full. TaskBook Storage is done similarly to StudentBook Storage. The only difference is the name of the classes (`JsonTaskBookStorage` instead of `JsonStudentBookStorage`, `JsonAdaptedTask` instead of `JsonAdaptedStudent` etc.)

<img src="images/LessonStorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The LessonBook Storage is slightly different from the StudentBook and TaskBook Storages.

The `Storage` component,
* can save student, task and lesson data as well as user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `StudentBookStorage`, `TaskBookStorage`, `LessonBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one of them (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `jarvis.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### List Students / Tasks / Lessons
To see the full list of students, tasks or lessons, the user keys in the valid command (`liststudent`, `listtask` or `listlesson`). As an example, the user keys in "`liststudent`". Parsing of the user input is done and a `ListStudentCommand` is then generated. The following sequence diagram shows what happens when the `ListStudentCommand` is executed.

<img src="images/ListStudentSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

1. The list of students in the model is updated to display all students.

The implementation for listing tasks and lessons is similar.

### Mark Task as done / not done
In order to mark a task as completed, the user keys in a valid command (e.g. `marktask 2`). Parsing of the user input is done (see the sequence diagram for deleting a student in the [Logic component](#logic-component) for a similar parsing sequence) and a `MarkTaskCommand` is then generated. The following sequence diagram shows what happens when the `MarkTaskCommand` is executed.

<img src="images/MarkTaskSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

1. First, the list of tasks is obtained and the index is matched to the corresponding task.
2. This task is then marked as done.
3. The list of tasks in the model is then updated in order to display the updated task in the UI.

The implementation for marking a task as not done is similar.

### Adding a Lesson

In order to add a Lesson into JARVIS, the user keys in a valid command (e.g. `addmc l/mastery check 1 sd/2022-09-15T20:00 ed/2022-09-15T20:30 si/1 si/2`)
Parsing of the user input is done and a `AddMasteryCheckCommand` is then generated. (See the sequence diagram for deleting a student in the [Logic component](#logic-component))

The sequence diagram is similar apart from:
1. the command executed and parsed (`addmc l/mastery check 1 sd/2022-09-15T20:00 ed/2022-09-15T20:30 si/1 si/2` instead of `deletestudent 2`)
2. the different command class (`AddMasteryCheckCommandParser` and `AddMasteryCheckCommand` instead of `DeleteStudentCommandParser` and `DeleteStudentCommand`)
3. function called in main (`addLesson` instead of `deleteStudent`)

`MasteryCheckCommandParser` checks if:

1. all prefixes are present
2. lesson description is not empty
3. start date time is before end date time
4. student indexes are int

Otherwise, `ParseException` will be thrown.

The rationale behind this design is that for all `Lesson`, there must be a `LessonDesc` present.
It is also illogical for a lesson to start after the end date time. A `Student` must also be assigned manually to a `MasteryCheck`
as the purpose of `MasteryCheck` is to assess a student's capability.

**Future Implementation**
- Allow user to input duration of lesson(in hours) to replace end date time
- JARVIS will calculate the end date time for user based on the given start date time and duration
- Helps to shorten the command required to be typed as lessons are likely to end on the same day


The following sequence diagram shows what happens when the `AddMasteryCheckCommand` is executed upon a successful command.

<img src="images/AddMasteryCheckSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

- `AddMasteryCheckCommand` will get the students involved in the `MasteryCheck` via indexing of the `lastShownList`. If no `Student` are found based on the index, `CommandException` will be thrown, stating invalid student index.
- After a `MasteryCheck` object is created, `Model` will check if there already exists a `MasteryCheck` in the current `LessonBook` with the same identity fields. If this is the case,`CommandException` will be thrown, stating duplicate Mastery Check.
- `Model` will also check with existing `Lessons` if there will be a clash in `TimePeriod`. This serves as a reminder to the user that there is already another lesson at that time slot. `CommandException` will be thrown, stating clash in timeslot.


The above explanation is also applicable to adding consultation and studio lessons.
They are similar apart from:
1. the different naming(`AddConsultCommandParser`, `AddStudioCommandParser` etc instead of `AddMasteryCheckParser`)
2. for `Studio`, all `Student` currently in the `StudentBook` instead of `FilteredStudentList` will be used to create `LessonAttendance` and `LessonNotes`
   1. Studio are tutorials and all students are expected to attend. 
   2. As a result, adding a Studio command does not require user to input student indexes.

### Adding notes for a lesson

In adding notes for an existing `Lesson` in JARVIS, the user has the option to:
1. add overall notes for a `Lesson`
2. add `Student` specific notes for a `Lesson` 

The rationale behind this design is that these are the two main types of notes that a tutor might make during a lesson. This design will help the tutor organise and view his/her notes more easily.

To add an overall note for an existing `Lesson` in JARVIS, the user keys in a valid add note command (e.g addnote n/get back to the class on streams li/1). 

To add a `Student` specific note to an existing `Lesson` in JARVIS, the user similarly keys in a valid add note command, but additionally specifying the student index (e.g addnote n/get back to jeff on streams li/1 si/2).

Parsing of the user input is done and a `AddNoteCommand` is then generated.

The following sequence diagram shows what happens when the `AddNoteCommand` is executed upon a successful command for adding to overall notes.

<img src="images/AddOverallNoteSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

1. `AddNoteCommand` gets the list of lessons in JARVIS and gets the `Lesson` specified by the lesson index.
2. `addOverallNotes` method of this lesson is called with the notes input by the user and the notes are added to the lesson.
3. The list of lessons in the model is then updated to display the notes added.

In the case where `AddNoteCommand` is executed for adding to student specific notes, the execution is similar except:
 - `AddNoteCommand` additionally gets the list of students in JARVIS and the specified `Student`
 - `addStudentNotes` is called instead of `addOverallNotes`.
